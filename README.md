As of the 16th of september, 2019, this game is in release 1.0.

It works as intended : two players can connect to the server and play successive games of BattleShip. 
Disconnecting means you forfeit.

The server supports players disconnecting abruptly, and tracks forfeits accordingly.

No more than two connections allowed at once.
